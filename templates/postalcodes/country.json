    "paragraph_template": "The postal code {Postal Code} is part of Ecuador’s national six-digit postal code system, overseen by Empresa Pública Correos del Ecuador, the country’s official postal authority. Ecuadorian postal codes follow the pattern X X X X X X, such as 1 7 0 1 X X (example only). The first two digits identify the province, the next two correspond to the canton, and the final digits define parish and delivery-zone routing. \n\nThis code represents {Area} in the {State} province, located near coordinates {Latitude} and {Longitude}. Routing follows Province → Canton → Parish → Delivery Zone. Example mapping: \n- Province: {State} \n- Canton: (Example: Central Canton Area) \n- Parish: {Area} \n- Delivery Zone: Based on last digits \n\nThis page reflects structural standards used by Correos del Ecuador. All sample codes are illustrative only. For accurate delivery, ensure province, canton, and parish match {Area}, {State}, Ecuador.",
